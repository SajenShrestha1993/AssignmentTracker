# Assignment-Todo-List (Angular App)

### What does the app do?
It is a simple todo-list application that students can use to keep track of their assignments.
The interface allows a user to create a list of Assignments and their due-dates and keep track of their submission status.
The applicaiton supports full CRUD funtionalities where any CRUD request happens by using simple ResfulAPIs that makes call to 
MognoDB to manipulate data.

The project was initiated to explore the core concepts of Angulat 7 by building a complete responsive application from scratch.

Core concepts explored: MVC architeture, SPA, Angular CLI, TypeScript, Angular directives, Data binding, Dynamic Routing, Rest API, RsJx, Angular Modules and Services, DI and Styling with Angular Material. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

### Techonology Stack:
1) Front-end UI using Angular 7
2) CRUD RestfulAPI using ExpressJS and Node
3) MongoDB Cloud as NoSql DB

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
